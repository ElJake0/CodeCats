          <article>
            <h2>Overview</h2><br>
            <p>
              As a group, there was a strong consensus that the dynamics between all group members contributed greatly to a successful outcome for Assignment 2. To improve efficiency, we implemented a team leadership structure which provided clarity,
              seamlessly streamlining communications and workflows. What worked to our advantage was that we were able to rely on each other in the sub-division of tasks. Additionally, we established a constant feedback loop and maintained
              communications during each stage of the assessment process.
              <br><br>
              After receiving our Assignment 2 results it became clear that the team had not collaborated enough on the website. There will be an increased focus on this for Assignment 3 and the team will allocate more time on that aspect of the
              assessment. Considering the increased collaborative nature of Assignment 3, the communication loop will have to be maintained if not strengthened. The team will also need to self-organise earlier to meet the demands of Assignment 3;
              this will essentially be managed in MS Teams in terms of roles, responsibilities, tasks, schedules, checklists and meeting minutes. We will also need to ensure that our individual SparkPlus feedback is specific on how each member
              contributed to the team.

          <h1>IDEAL JOBS</h1><br><br>
          <article>
            <p>After comparing everyone’s ideal job, we have discovered some of us had the same ideal job; both Chelsea and Arian goals are to be game programmers, and Jake and Yvette want to be full-stack web developers. Ashwin’s ideal job is a
              software developer, and Eun Mi’s is to become a cybersecurity analyst. Apart from Eun Mi, everyone wants to be a type of developer, and technical skills are essential. Learning programming languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, HTML,
              CSS, and C++ are common elements for becoming a developer. On the other hand, Eun Mi requires a broad range of IT knowledge and a solid understanding of network security and systems. Though she does not need to learn programming or
              database languages in-depth, she might still need to understand a bit of Python. For Ashwin, platform and tool knowledge are additional useful skills. <button class="expandButton" onclick="expandAV()">Click to expand or hide article.</button></p>
            <br><br>
          </article>

          <article id="expandarticleAV">
            <p>Most of us have a little bit of knowledge and experience with some of these tech skills. We want to pursue them further professionally, which is the primary motivation for enrolling in ‘Introduction to Information Technology’ at RMIT,
              which is prerequisite for completing a computer science qualification. Working experience in our desired field seems to be crucial as well, such as participating in an internship to gain familiarity and guidance from experienced
              professionals.
            <p>
              <br><br>
            <p>Apart from tech skills, we also need general skills. We all agreed communication skills, interpersonal skills, problem-solving skills, and teamwork skills are essential in working in a group and interacting with the management team or
              clients. Regardless of which area one will be working in, these are the fundamental skills employers are seeking. We believe we can develop these general skills while we work on assignments as a group. </p>

              full stack developer necessarily needs to contribute to other aspects of a complete web project – these skills include user interface and experience design, colour, and typography theories. Backend skills such as knowledge of databases
              (such as SQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB), networking and cybersecurity are also required. Both Yvette and Jake also require experience and knowledge of web design such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Eun Mi requires specialized knowledge on
              network security, information systems, cryptography, and vulnerability assessment, augmented with a broad understanding of a range of IT Technologies and programming languages, especially Python. </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3>IT Specific Skills</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p> As a team, Code – Cat’s required skill set consist of a wide range of skills. IT specific skills related to programming languages are knowledge of C++, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Java, Ruby and Python. Database related skills consist of
              SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. Skills using platforms and services include NodeJS, GIT and Amazon Web Services. Vue and React to create interfaces, Mocha and Chai for testing. Additionally, broader skills and knowledge is required in

            <h3>General Skills</h3>
            <br><br>
            <p>In addition to IT specific skills, employers also require several general skills. Code – Cat’s primary required general skills are interpersonal skills, communication skills, problem solving and teamwork. Troubleshooting, creativity,
              research skills, time management, quality assurance and control, and meeting deadlines are also required. Employer demand ranks communication skill as the most sought after, followed by problem solving and teamwork. The top three highly

            <h3>Gaming Industry Data</h3>
            <br><br>

            <p>The burning glass data provided did not mention many specific game development skills; two members of Code-Cats have ideal jobs in the industry. As such we are including some other data found specific to this segment of IT. The video
              game industry in Australia is a sizable portion of the IT sector, it was worth 2.96 billion in 2017 (Brand et al., cited in IGEA 2018). </p>

            <p>During the global Coronavirus pandemic, there was a significant surge, going up to 3.4 billion (Consultancy.org 2021). With the mobile gaming industry (Arians chosen field) consisting of a large portion of its developmental focus - 55%
              and 49% of studios focusing on Android and IOS development, respectively. As the industry is experiencing significant growth, it can be inferred that video game development positions will also experience parallel growth (Brand et al.,
              cited in IGEA 2018). According to the same data, 33% of game studio employees are programmers. </p>

          <article>
            <h2>Overview</h2><br>
            <p>
              When analyzing the reviewed career summaries for our group there are three groups of jobs that stand out. Chelsea and Arian both have the stated goal of becoming game developers, Ashwin and Yvette are focusing on the path to become
              software developers, while Eun Mi and Jake are looking towards other IT industry roles, cybersecurity analyst and generalised IT professional respectively. While our stated ideal role overlap with some general skills, we are all
              targeting specific skills that differentiate the necessities of our idea roles.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              Currently the group covers a broad range of skills from marketing, communication, and project management, to networking, authentication analysis, and web development. With the skills currently possessed, each group member has as a
              strong foundation to begin their chosen industry path and become industry leaders of the future.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              Each of the members of the group have begun upskilling in the direction of their long term goals. All members are planning to further their programming skills, targeting C, C++, and Python specifically, with Eun Mi, Jake, Yvette, and
              Arian also focusing on JavaScript skills. The general IT skills are being bolstered by role specific skills, Yvette and Ashwin are focusing on database management experience for their software development aspirations, Chelsea and Arian
              are looking planning to master C#, Eun Mi has planned to complete cybersecurity certifications, and Jake is looking to gain experience in data center management.
