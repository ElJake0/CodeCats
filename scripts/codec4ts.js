  document.getElementById("bio").innerHTML = "Chelsea currently lives in Townsville QLD, where she works as a Daycare Teacher. She has always had an interest in IT, particularly when it comes to videogames. Videogames have always been a massive part of her life. She would use them as an escape when she was a child, often spending hours on her Game Boy trying to complete her Pokédex in Pokémon Yellow. She dabbled in a few IT classes in high school, obtaining Certificate I and II in IT. Career-wise, she spent a few years as an IT Support Technician, offering rudimentary tech support, which usually involved assisting elderly customers with their emails. Although she enjoyed this role, she did not find it particularly challenging, which is a big part as to why she has decided to enter into a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Outside of IT, her hobbies include drawing, cooking and learning Japanese. ";
  document.getElementById("overview").innerHTML = "Overview: Chelsea is an INFJ. INFJs are considered to be creative, nurturing, insightful and future-oriented individuals. They are described as deep and complex idealists; despite being reserved and quiet. They are considered natural and passionate leaders and are constantly seeking meaning and purpose in everything, but they also have the ability to work logically and rationally when necessary. INFJs tend to have excellent communication skills, especially when it comes to writing. Warm and affirming, they are committed to a better tomorrow and will continuously try to make everyone's life a little bit better. They are also passionate, with a strong sense of personal integrity, and when they determine that something is important to them, they will pursue that goal no matter what. Because of this, they tend to burn out easily. Their sensitive nature leads them to be very private and selective when sharing thoughts and information. Because of this, they can be reluctant to approach or engage people who differ from them, making them hard to get to know (NERIS Analytics 2021)."
  document.getElementById("reflection").innerHTML = "Reflection: As indicated in the results, an INFJs traits are very conflicting, with which I resonate. Personally, I do not consider myself a leader in any sense of the word. I am, however, very passionate and goal orientated, and so when it comes to seeing those goals to fruition, I can be quite outspoken and yet, in all other aspects of my life, come across as very reserved, timid even. I often try to find ways to express myself creatively, but as someone very private and sensitive to criticism, I tend to be very selective of who I choose to share that side of myself with. I am extremely loyal and regularly put the needs of friends and family before my own, often leading me to take on too much. To reach a healthy balance, I need to open myself up and have a little more faith in the decision's others make.";

The most idealistic and dedicated of personality types can become frustrated when it comes to navigating interpersonal conflicts, confronting unpleasant facts, pursuing self-realization, or finding a fulfilling career path. They can be sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up and can be easily burnout’ (NERIS Analytics 2021). "

Apart from English he can speak Malay conversationally. He has a background in industrial design and has some experience with graphic design and illustration. He has been fascinated with computers and technology since he was young. He especially likes the act of creating something new and thinking about possible implications and applications. He doesn’t have any professional experience with IT, but he has self-learned some rudimentary Flash, HTML, CSS and Python. In his free time, he likes to exercise - specifically power and Olympic lifting or ride my bicycle around the nearby lake. He also enjoys playing video games, cooking, listening to history and philosophy podcasts, and petting his cat Nebby.  ";
  document.getElementById("overview").innerHTML = "Overview: For the Myers Briggs personality test, Ashwin Royan’s results are INFP-T or a ‘Turbulent Mediator’ personality. Mediators are quiet and private with idealistic perspectives. Mediators typically get along with others and try to resolve problems and antagonisms. Turbulent mediators tend to use their idealism to determine the best course of action to improve themselves and resolve problems. Their weaknesses tend to be expecting too much of themselves and getting overwhelmed with unrealistic expectations. Small mistakes, in their eyes tend to lead to doubts and passivity. As for the learning style test, Ashwin Royan scored high on the ‘reflector’ learning style. Reflectors prefer to observe and absorb information cautiously – collecting and analysing before reaching a conclusion. Reflectors usually see a big picture using previous experience and the current situation (NERIS Analytics 2021). "
  document.getElementById("reflection").innerHTML = "Reflection: The Discussions, time to absorb information and feedback from others are useful for this learning style. As for the Big 5 personality test; Ashwin Royan got a low score on extroversion and a higher score for intellect, imagination, and agreeableness. The scores are a scale relative to other people who have taken the test. I think that this test is accurate in that I do tend to be quite introverted and quiet. This tends to lead in my neglecting to mention as much information is necessary or getting help before I need it. These results help me be more aware of my strengths and weaknesses and help me realise what I can work on to improve in a team setting. For example, I can improve by communicating more – both my opinions and problems. The results also help me understand that I need time to process information so should refrain from doing work at the last minute.  ";

In her spare time, she enjoys watching AFL and cricket games and listening to music.  ";
  document.getElementById("overview").innerHTML = "Overview: Eunmi is an ‘Assertive Defender’. Defenders prefer to support others over taking the lead. They are generous in sharing their knowledge and experience with others, and feel pride in making contributions that go beyond what others may expect. Defenders feel a deep sense of responsibility towards their peers, which means they are very reliable and will consistently exercise patience and respectful behaviour. Given their nature, however, Defenders can appear introverted, as their strong empathetic nature causes them to fear they may offend others, often deterring them from expressing their ideas and feelings. In terms of learning style, Eunmi is a ‘Theorist’. Theorists tend to adopt a logical approach, preferring facts and objectivity to imagination and speculation. They like to find patterns in data, and make assessments and evaluations according to accepted principles and theoretical models. Their desire for structure makes Theorists disciplined and highly organised. In Big Five Tests, Eunmi was strong in Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness, which is consistent with her results as both an Assertive Defender and a Theorist. Overall, Eunmi is organised, disciplined and thorough; consequently, she likes routine and planning. These traits, however, can lead her to be anxious and stressed if she encounters situations that are less structured or concrete. (NERIS Analytics 2021). "

I am shy and humble, so I will not be suitable as a leader, however I can help others by being supportive, reliable, patient, and empathetic. I can contribute to creating an amicable and comfortable environment throughout the group project. As shown in the test results, I am strong at organising, planning, checking details, and finishing things on time. I can utilise these strengths in the group to organise meetings, taking meeting minutes, and checking our timeline to ensure everyone is on track to complete the assignment. In the meantime, I will need to be careful not to take things too personally and try to speak up and share my ideas instead of suppressing myself. Opening myself up and proactively communicating with others will help me release any stress and worries. ";

As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are. There’s hardly a better type to make up such a large proportion of the population, nearly 13%.

They thrive in supportive environments where everyone is seen as equal and are open about their ideas and opinions. As they value freedom above all else, ENFP’s are highly independent and perform best when they are not being micromanaged even though this may sometimes be necessary. They are not usually known to be great at administrative tasks involving routine upkeep and needs someone to handle organisational matters. They also tend to overthink, get stressed easily and are prone to being too hard on themselves especially in situations where they believe they have made a mistake. However, these types are generally open-minded, creative and particularly adaptable to almost every other personality type and can easily adopt new ways of thinking and communication styles into their vocabulary.

I am extroverted as I get most of my energy from spending time with others, but I also need time to myself too. There are certain aspects that I believe, due to the process of active development, have improved over time; especially in terms of routine upkeep, I am a lot more structured when it comes to work or study than I use to be; this is perhaps most apparent in my Big-Five conscientiousness scores. I strongly believe that none of us will ever be perfect and that we as individuals should always strive to better ourselves in areas where we are weak. Where I am currently wishing to improve most is my tendency to overthink, especially when it comes to other people’s feelings. I think a good strategy for me is to give people the benefit of the doubt and take less time trying to make sure everyone is happy, although I probably will not ever be able to not care at all as I would not be true to myself then. As for learning styles I am fairly balanced and learn best through incorporating all four approaches. At the end of the day, I like to see how theory can be put into practice.";
