            <h3>What are Autonomous Vehicles?</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Autonomous vehicles, also known as ‘driverless cars’ or ‘automated vehicles’,are vehicles that offer the automation of tasks that we associate with driving. Vehicle automation can beregistered on a scale of zero to five(NHTSA2020).</p>
              <br>

              <ol>
                <li>No automation -A human driver performs all driving tasks.</li>
                <li>Driver assistance -A single automated feature is offered. E.g., Cruise Control</li>
                <li>Partial automation -Features ADAS or Advanced DriverAssistance Systems that enables the vehicle to perform steering and acceleration;however, a human is still required to monitor the vehicle and can take control at any time.</li>
                <li>Conditional automation -Offers environmental detection capabilities that enable the vehicle to perform most driving tasks;however,human override is still required.</li>
                <li>High automation –Enablesthe vehicle to perform all tasks without human interaction;however,human override is still an option. </li>
                <li>Full automation –A vehicle is considered fully automated when it is able to perform all driving tasks without the need for any human interaction or attention.</li>
              </ol>

              <br>
              <p>Today, the most common form of automated vehicles are new cars that offer conditional automation (level 3) features,such as environmental detection capabilities that can perform most driving tasks, including accelerating, braking, turning or changing lanes. These tasks are delivered via a computer system but still require human override(NHTSA 2020).</p>
              <br>
              <p>Although high automation (level 4) vehicles are currently not available to the everyday consumer, there has been significant development in the deployment of these vehicles. Because of thecurrent limitations on legislation and infrastructure, the development of these vehicles has predominately been geared towardsshuttles,ridesharing and robotaxis.A small number of these vehicles are currently operationalaround the world, including Western Australia(NHTSA 2020). </p>

              <br>
              <p>When it comes to the technology behind the automation, most companies currently deploying conditional and high automated vehicles usethe same base level of technology. This technology includes:</p>

                  <p class="textRight">Machine Learning-A type of Artificial Intelligence that uses a computer system that utilises a combination of algorithms and statistics to find patterns in data. These systems can then use that data to learn, adapt and make decisions without the need for human intervention (IBM 2020). Machine Learning provides the vehicle the ability to collect and interpret data on its surroundings based on information provided by cameras and sensors. This vehicle then uses this information to decide what actions to take. </p>

                  <img class="imgLeft" src="../assets/LiDAR.png">
                  <p class="textRight">LiDAR-A detection system that uses light pulses from a laser to measure variable distances (NOAA 2021).LiDAR provides autonomous vehicles the ability to ‘see’, in the sense that it provides a 360-degree view of its surroundings. This is done using a continuously rotating LiDAR system, allowing the vehicle to detect obstructions, avoiding collisions and resulting in a smoother ride. </p>

                  <p class="textRight">Ultrasonic Sensors-A sensor that gauges the distance between objects by using high-frequency sound waves and measuring the time between emission and reception (Maxbotix 2021). Similar to LiDAR, ultrasonic sensorsallow the vehicle to detect obstacles, however, unlike LiDAR, it provides the unique ability to see through objects, making them ideal in bad weather (Medium 2020). </p>

              <h3>Impact of Autonomous Vehicles</h3>
              <br>
              <p>As these technologies change and adapt, we will likely see fully automated (level 5) vehicles in testing phases over the next few years, resulting in more accessibility for the everyday consumer. The overall impact, be that positive or negative, will be significant.</p>

              <br>
              <h3>Impact on Jobs</h3>
              <br>
              <p>With the implementation of autonomous vehicles essentially making drivers redundant, perhaps the most obvious job affected would be the drivers of ridesharing services (Uber, Lyft etc.). Globally, there are currently over 3 million drivers working for Uber alone,and on average, each driver earns around $364 per month (Blair n.d). By removing the need to employ drivers, Uber can potentially cut their running costs by over $1.3 billion. </p>
              <br>
              <p>As technology changes and evolves, theDepartment of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources(DIIS) suggests that there is also the potential for employment growth across severalsectors,both existing and potentially entirely new industries, these industries include manufacturing, mining and agriculture (Parliament of Australia 2017).</p>

              <br>
              <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Most companies developing autonomous vehicles are doing so with the aim to utilise electric vehicles as opposed to hybrid or combustion engine vehicles. It is estimated that using electric vehicles would reduce the amount of harmful greenhouse gas emissions by around 60% (Elezaj 2021). There has been some debate amongst researchers concerning whether an all-electric based autonomous vehicle will lead to significantly increased power needs, and as a result, autonomous vehicles would need to be gas-electric hybrids (Brewer 2020).</p>

              <br>
              <h3>Safety Impact</h3>
              <br>
              <p>It is estimated that 90% of all fatalities on the road are directly attributed to human error. These errors include speeding, drink/drug driving and distractions in and out of the vehicle (mobile phone use, exhaustion etc.) (NRSP 2013). Globally, 1.3 million people are killed in road accidents every year (WHO 2020). Australia alone reports an average of 1000 fatalities annually (BITRE 2020). Autonomous vehicles provide the ability to remove manual driving controls altogether, resulting in the eradication of all fatalities attributed to human error (NHSA 2020). </p>

              <br>
              <h3>How Will This Effect You?</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Personally, the implementation of fully autonomous (level 5) vehicles at a consumer level will have a significantimpact on my life. As an epileptic, although medically cleared to, I do not drive due to the potentialrisk imposed onmyself andothers.To go from place to place, I rely heavily on friends, family,and public transport. Autonomous vehicles have the capability to not only create safe driving environments but also provide me with a steady, reliable,independent mode of transport.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Without the need for a driver, these vehicles also have the potential to assist friends and family members who are new parents or have young children. Parents and caregivers will be able to focus all of their attention on those insidethe vehicle without having to be concerned aboutpotential distractions both inside and outside.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With the ability to eradicate human driving errors, they have the potential to not only make roads safer fordrivers but also pedestrians. This is especially significantto me as my father was fatally struck by a speeding vehicle in 2018. </p>
              <br>
              <p>Overall, the implementation of autonomous vehicles into society is largely positive but does,however,come with many drawbacks. As we are severalyears away from a fully autonomous vehicle becoming a staple in everyday life, the companies developing them have time to address these concerns with their ever-changing and adaptable technologies. </p>
