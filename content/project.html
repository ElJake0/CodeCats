          <h1>METRO NEKO</h1>
          <br>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <article>
            <br>
            <h3>Topic</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Our project proposal is to design a 2D-side scroller game so that it can be compatible on both iOS and Android mobile operating systems. We want to make the project simple and easy to understand yet challenging enough to keep the player engaged. The player must complete each level in the most time efficient way, while collecting coins and avoiding depleting health levels. Successful players receive higher bonus points on the scoreboard.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              We imagine the game aesthetics to have a dark theme. Set in a dystopian futuristic city, backed by a neon skyline backdrop, our main character (a cat) will have to maneuver its way through the city – jumping from platform to platform, avoiding various obstacles and enemies along the way. The music will complement the overall gloomy vibe, with eerie techno music accompanying the players’ gameplay experience. We hope to complete at least Level 1, to serve as the basis for future iterations and to provide an expectation the skills required by the player to succeed as the game continues to the next levels. We hope the players will experience it as an homage to old-school gaming culture in a romanticised 2D world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              Our project is focused on meeting current market demands. Statistically, 81% of gamers play on mobile devices, with puzzle/platform games the second-most popular genre after simulation games (GWI 2021). Side-scrolling games have been popular since the eighties and remain so: of the top 100 ranked games on the Apple App Store, 50 are 2-D titles. Side-scrolling platformers are a style of game everyone can enjoy, regardless of age or ability, and thus have remained popular despite advances in technology. The top reasons for playing games include for enjoyment, storylines and escaping from reality (GWI 2021); as such, with its interesting narrative and simple controls, our game will appeal to a broad range of gamers. By completing this project, we would be able to demonstrate to future employers our experience in all stages of developing a commercially viable product, including conceptualisation, market research, planning, programming and editing.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Landscape</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              While many side-scrolling platformers already exist, the huge demand for mobile games means enthusiasts are constantly seeking fresh new experiences. Among the most popular titles are Super Mario Run, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and Rayman Jungle Run. What separates our product from these types of games is a more mature aesthetic and narrative, which will attract adult gamers; having said this, with its simple controls and appealing main character, our game will still be accessible for all types of gamers. The main frustrations consumers have reported regarding their gaming experiences are games that do not run smoothly, are too expensive to progress in, or too hard to play. Our product promises to provide consistently high framerates, will not require in-app purchases, and will be challenging enough to engage players without the need to master a difficult set of controls.

          <h2>Aims</h2>
          <br>
          <article>
            <p>
              In this project, we aim to develop the first level of our game as a proof-of-concept. The game will support a widescreen 16:9 ratio, and the characters and certain objects will be animated. It will also include sound effects corresponding to the playable character and enemies’ actions, and theme music. In terms of programming, the C# script will implement simple 2D physics to simulate gravity and allow the user to control the playable character. A list of specific goals for each of these categories follows:
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Static Visuals and Animations</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              To engage players, our game needs to include an aesthetically pleasing environment, and interesting animations. We will create original artwork for the background, which will scroll at a different aspect to the character and other objects to simulate depth. Animations will be developed for the main character’s motions, including running, jumping, falling and dying, as well as for the movement of enemies and the rotation of coins.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Sound Effects</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              To create atmosphere and act as feedback to players, our game should have sound effects that correspond to the action of the scene. Original theme music will be composed, of approximately one minute in length; this will loop as the user plays. Short tunes will also be required to signal a player’s achievements at the completion of the level. We will create individual sounds for the enemies, and for the playable character for instances of falling off a platform, touching an enemy, collecting coins, and completing the game. All sounds will be in stereo.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              The main character must respond the player’s inputs, and the game itself needs to possess realistic physics to support interaction between the main character and the environment.  The main character must be able to move left and right, and jump. Enemies should begin moving left and right once they are visible. The main character should fall if not standing on a platform, while the coins need to remain suspended in the air until collected. At the end of the level, the player’s time and score will be written to a locally stored XML file.

          <h2>Plans & Progress</h2>

          <h3>Planning</h3>
          <br>
          <article>
            <p>
              <i>What are we building?</i>
              <br><br>
              Code Cats are developing a single player, 2D action platformer game titled Metro Neko. With its side-scroller dynamic, Metro Neko will be easy to understand whilst its increasingly challenging gameplay, unique characters and vibrant atmosphere will keep players engaged.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <i>Who is our target audience?</i>
              <br><br>
              According to WePC, there are 2.7 billion gamers globally (WEPC 2021). Of this, Asia-Pacific accounts for 49.2%, North America at 25.1%, Europe at 18.6%, Latin America at 3.8% and the Middle East & Africa at 3.4% (WEPC 2021). Taking this into account, along with the average age of gamers being 33 (GWI 2021), Metro Neko’s target audience will be consumers aged 18-34, marketed towards those in Asia-Pacific and North America.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <i>Competition:</i>
              <br><br>
              Metro Neko’s competition is mostly mobile games. Google Play Store and Apple App store are the main targets of the game. We mainly focus on user interface, and we are making the game more user friendly while keeping the promotions and ads to help with finding the right audience. We are also looking to use platforms that boost ranking of Metro Neko in Google Play Store ranking. Lastly, we will be creating a website to accompany the game to introduce it to more people across the web.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <i>Which platform/s will it be on?</i>
              <br><br>
              With multi-device ownership not being uncommon in today’s age, 81% of consumers play games on their smartphones and tablets whilst 65% play games on their PC/laptops (GWI 2021). In order for Metro Neko to reach as many players as possible, it will be made available across multiple platforms, first being introduced on mobile devices (Android and iOS) with further development necessary before being made available on PC.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <i>Key features</i>
              <br><br>
              GWI states that 70% of gamers play games for one main reason, it is fun. Of that 70%, 50% are more likely to stop playing a game because they either lose interest or the game did not meet their expectations (GWI 2021). Metro Neko’s key features have been designed with consumer engagement at the forefront. Features include:
              <ul>
                <li>A unique main character</li>
                <li>A defined nemesis</li>
                <li>Enemies to destroy</li>
                <li>Objects/points to collect</li>
                <li>Vibrant world/environment</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <i>Who are the characters?</i>
              <br><br>
              With over 373 million cats kept as pets world-wide (WORLDATLAS 2020), it is obvious that people love cats. Our team at Code Cats is no exception to that statistic and so Metro Neko was developed as a result of our shared love of cats and animals in general in mind. Metro Neko will feature several cat-based characters, including:
              <ul>
                <li>Senshi: Our hero and the games playable character</li>
                <li>Miyako: Senshi’s nemesis and overall game villain</li>
                <li>White Ghost Cats: In-game enemy/obstacle that cannot be destroyed</li>
                <li>OZombie Cats: In-game enemy/obstacle that can be destroyed</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <i>When and where does it take place?  </i>
              <br><br>
              Metro Neko will take place in a city of the same name, in a dystopian-type future where all citizens are cats. The streets of Metro Neko are dark and ominous with vibrant pops of neon colours.
