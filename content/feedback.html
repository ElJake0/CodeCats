            <h3>How well does the audit trail on the git repository? </h3>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Using Git has been a new and interesting collaborative experience for our team members. Arian and Jake were the designated web developers in charge of building the website and integrating all of the assessment content generated by the
              other group members. They are responsible for all of the commits on the current group project and, while also consulting the other group members, they held the most conversations regarding how the site should be constructed from a
              technical standpoint. Taking advantage of the learning experiences that GitHub was offering, both our web developers relied on the command line to make commits and push content to the repository. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>In total our project to date has had 29 commits split 16 and 13 respectively between Arian and Jake. Most commits were significant changes to the website layout or major content alterations, with our communication style any minor tweaks were made and
              committed along with broader changes to the website. </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img class="border" src="../assets/content/tools/Screen Shot 2021-04-21 at 18.46.28.png" alt="Screenshot GitHub">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Early on in the process of this website building Arian designed a website template which the group agreed would be the foundation of this component of the assessment. With the template in mind Jake determined that the most efficient
              and effective way to transpose the template design into HTML and CSS would be to use his experience with CSS grid. </p>
            <br><br>

            <p>Due to already being familiar with the framework provided by CSS grid Jake volunteered to initialise the GitHub repository and begin building the framework for the website, this is illustrated in the graph by many early commits and a
              peak just before the 8th of April. When it came to the more nuanced aspects of the website, such as the JavaScript dropdown menus and mobile inclusive layout, Arian’s expertise shine through, as this work was more detailed it is
              evidenced through a similar peak in commits around the 10th of April. Both trend lines of commits are bearish after the 11th as primarily this period was mostly dedicated to content integration. </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img class="border" src="../assets/content/tools/Screen Shot 2021-04-21 at 18.45.26.png" alt="Screenshot GitHub">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>We feel as if the trend lines do reflect the respective work that was put in. While Jake’s entries were earlier in the project they focused on establishing an efficient base that Arian could build on top of. The trend lines accurately depict the hand over of who was taking charge of the website building at the beginning stage and the end stage.</p>

          <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <br>
          <article>
            <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p><b>What went well?</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Each team members comments were pretty consistent on what we thought went well. We all agreed that forming our group early played a defining role when it came to communication and the delegation of tasks. We were able to build a
              foundation of trust and mutual respect, which in turn made collaboration between the group efficient and effective. With a friendly and supportive environment, we were able to set and meet in-group deadlines for tasks that were assigned
              based on everyone’s individual strengths, of which everyone made their best effort to contribute equally. </p>

            <br><br>
            <p><b>What could be improved? </b></p>
            <br>
            <p>When it came to thoughts on what could potentially be improved, two main suggestions came up amongst the group, the first being leadership. Although we currently have leadership in the form of Chelsea as Group Co-ordinator, we did not
              assign one for the first couple of weeks. This, in turn, led to uncertainty when it came to assigning and following up on tasks. After implementing a leadership role, our work became more structured and efficient, and so going into
              assignment three, organising leadership should be one of the first things that we do. It was also suggested that improvements could also be made when it came to providing feedback. As everyone in our group is so supportive, there have
              been instances where members were hesitant to provide anything but positive feedback. As we continued working together and building trust and respect, we slowly became more open to providing constructive feedback. </p>


            <br><br>
            <p><b>What is one thing that surprised you? </b></p>
            <br>

            <p>One thought that ran constant throughout our group was that everyone was surprised by how easy it was to communicate with each other, even though we had all only just met online. In many group situations, there is usually the concern
              that a member is not going to pull their weight or just not communicate with the group at all. At no point throughout this assignment have we had those concerns. Everyone has been equally reliable when it came to organising and
              completing tasks as well as communicating. </p>


            <br><br>
            <p><b>What is one thing that you have learned about groups? </b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Overall, we have all learned a lot about groups. We have found that joining a group early is a great way to ensure your linked with like-minded, proactive individuals. We have learnt that when it comes to making sure a group runs
              smoothly and efficiently, communication is key and that in order to establish effective communication, you need to trust and support those in your group. </p>
