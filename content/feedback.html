            <h3>How well does the audit trail on the git repository? </h3>
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Using Git has been a new and interesting collaborative experience for our team members. Arian and Jake were the designated web developers in charge of building the website and integrating all of the assessment content generated by the
              other group members. They are responsible for all of the commits on the current group project and, while also consulting the other group members, they held the most conversations regarding how the site should be constructed from a
              technical standpoint. Taking advantage of the learning experiences that GitHub was offering, both our web developers relied on the command line to make commits and push content to the repository. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>In total our project to date has had 29 commits split 16 and 13 respectively between Arian and Jake. Most commits were significant changes to the website layout or major content alterations, with our communication style any minor tweaks were made and
              committed along with broader changes to the website. </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img class="border" src="../assets/content/tools/Screen Shot 2021-04-21 at 18.46.28.png" alt="Screenshot GitHub">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>Early on in the process of this website building Arian designed a website template which the group agreed would be the foundation of this component of the assessment. With the template in mind Jake determined that the most efficient
              and effective way to transpose the template design into HTML and CSS would be to use his experience with CSS grid. </p>
            <br><br>

            <p>Due to already being familiar with the framework provided by CSS grid Jake volunteered to initialise the GitHub repository and begin building the framework for the website, this is illustrated in the graph by many early commits and a
              peak just before the 8th of April. When it came to the more nuanced aspects of the website, such as the JavaScript dropdown menus and mobile inclusive layout, Arian’s expertise shone through, as this work was more detailed it is
              evidenced through a similar peak in commits around the 10th of April. Both trend lines of commits are bearish after the 11th as primarily this period was mostly dedicated to content integration. </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img class="border" src="../assets/content/tools/Screen Shot 2021-04-21 at 18.45.26.png" alt="Screenshot GitHub">
            <br><br><br>
            <p>We feel as if the trend lines do reflect the respective work that was put in. While Jake’s entries were earlier in the project they focused on establishing an efficient base that Arian could build on top of. The trend lines accurately depict the hand over of who was taking charge of the website building at the beginning stage and the end stage.</p>

          <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <br>
          <article>
            <h2>Group Reflection</h2>
            <br>
            <p><b>What went well? </b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Every team member agreed we worked together very well as a group on Assignment 3 and 5. Firstly, the consensus was it was more organised than Assignment 2, thanks to Chelsea, our team leader. She created a tasks planner, chair schedule, and meeting minutes table in MS teams in advance. It helped everyone knows exactly what to do, and when. The early assignment of tasks made the teamwork more efficient and exceeded our expectations, even though we had less time working on this assignment.  </p>
            <br>
            <p>Like Assignment 2, the team agreed we had good communication throughout the project. Via MS teams and Discord, we regularly communicated about our progress, and shared suggestions, feedback, and personal events. The bonds we formed previously continued to grow and contributed to creating a proactive and supportive team environment. </p>

            <br><br>
            <p><b>What could be improved? </b></p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of us mentioned things to improve from a personal perspective, including time management or being more proactive; however, overall, our team found there is not much for us to improve as a team. In Assignment 2, a lack of leadership at the early stage and organisation were things to improve and both have advanced in Assignment 3 and 5. Though it is minor, being aligned with the understanding of the task brief at an early stage would have been helpful to avoid any inconsistency in terms of the formatting of work. We could have also prepared better for meetings to encourage more ideas, suggestions and discussion.   </p>


            <br><br>
            <p><b>What is one thing that surprised you? </b></p>
            <br>

            <p>It is great to see we all were surprised with how dedicated, supportive, caring, reliable, and diligent every member is. During Assignment 3 and 5, we had several challenges which we had not faced before. The timeframe was shorter, with more tasks to complete. Our team lead was away for a while due to a family emergency. Some of us started new jobs and had to juggle these commitments with our studies. Some of us had other assignments to do from other courses. Though we faced these challenges, we continued communicating actively, feeling connected, supporting each other, and strengthening our bonds. We were all impressed with how well our group worked together as a team and the trust we had in one another.    </p>


            <br><br>
            <p><b>What is one thing that you have learned about groups? </b></p>
            <br>
            <p>We all agreed it was a great learning experience working as a group. We thought it would be challenging to achieve good teamwork as we are different in personalities, preferences, and communication and study styles. On top of that, the course is entirely online. However, we learned building bonds and relationships, together with efficient communication, can help overcome challenges and lead to success.   We also learned that forming a group at an early stage was the key to success, since it demonstrated everyone was accountable, proactive, and dedicated, and gave us more time to get to know each other developing genuine connections.    </p>
